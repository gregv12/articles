# Introduction
Welcome to Fluxtion streaming and thanks for coming, hope you enjoy exploring :) 

Fluxtion is a java utility that builds embeddable, reactive complex event processors. 
With the streaming api use functional programming to define business logic, simple clean Java code 
creates real-time applications. All the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion, 
programs are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.

Fluxtion focuses on the processing logic of event streams, independent of messaging system. Areas of good fit include:

-  **Embedding real-time processing** within an existing system
-  **Edge processing** executing on edge devices
-  **No middleware vendor lock-in** works with any messaging provider
-  **Low latency** or high performance requirements
-  **Auditable systems** supports ahead of time compilation 

Data streams can be merged, filtered, aggregated, joined, grouped and enriched. 
Windowing of data is fully supported. User functions are easily integrated to directly execute actions in addition to real-time monitoring.

A full set of tools for debugging, tracing, auding and visualisation are provided to reduce development and support costs.
